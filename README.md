# Swifty Proteins

### This project aims to introduce us to Scene Kit which is a high-level 3D graphics framework that helps us create 3D animated scenes and effects in the app.

In this project we used the following: rcsb.org, MVC, FBSDKCoreKit, GoogleSignIn, Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, SVProgressHUD, ChameleonFramework, SceneKit.

### Mandatory part
Before begining the core of the projet add an icon to your application AND a <br>
Launchscreen and make sure the launchscreen stays some time so we can appreciate it! <br>

#### Login ViewController:
• A user must be able to login with Face ID / Touch ID using a button <br>
• If login fails you must display a popup warning authentication failed <br>
• If the iPhone is not compatible the Touch ID login button should be hidden <br>
• The LoginViewController should ALWAYS be displayed when launching the app meaning <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if you press the Home button and relaunch the app whitout quitting it, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; it should show the LoginViewController ! <br>
#### Protein List ViewController:
• You must list all the ligands provided in ligands.txt (see resources) <br>
• You should be able to search a ligand through the list <br>
• If you cannot load the ligand through the website display a warning popup <br>
• When loading the ligand you should display the spinning wheel of the activity monitor <br>
#### Protein ViewController:
• Display the ligand model in 3D <br>
• You must use CPK coloring <br>
• You should at least represent the ligand using Balls and Sticks model <br>
• When clicking on an atom display the atom type (C, H, O, etc.) <br>
• Share your modelisation through a ‘Share‘ button <br>
• You should be able to ‘play‘ (zoom, rotate...) with the ligand in Scene Kit <br>

### Bonus
• Use of custom cells <br>
• Design <br>
• Custom popup <br>
• Other modelisation available <br>
• Custom message when sharing your screenshot <br>
• .... <br>
